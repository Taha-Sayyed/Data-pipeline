# 🎧 Spotify Data Pipeline (ETL) 

> A comprehensive data engineering project that builds an automated ETL pipeline for Spotify music data using AWS cloud services, transforming raw JSON data into actionable insights through SQL analytics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project creates a fully automated **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** pipeline that processes Spotify playlist data and generates meaningful music analytics. The pipeline extracts data from Spotify's API, transforms it into structured datasets, and enables powerful SQL-based analysis of music trends and patterns.

**Key Achievement**: Automated daily data processing with zero manual intervention, transforming complex JSON structures into clean, queryable datasets for music analytics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Music enthusiasts and data analysts often struggle to:
- Access structured data from streaming platforms for analysis
- Automate the collection and processing of music metadata
- Generate insights about artist popularity, song trends, and album performance
- Scale data processing without manual intervention

This pipeline solves these challenges by creating an end-to-end automated system for Spotify data processing and analysis.

## 📁 Data Structure

The pipeline organizes data into three main categories:



## 📈 Available Analytics

The pipeline enables comprehensive music analysis through various SQL queries:

### 🎵 Song Analytics
- Track popularity rankings and trends
- Song duration analysis and patterns
- Recently added songs tracking
- Zero vs. high popularity song identification

### 🎤 Artist Analytics
- Artist popularity scoring based on song performance
- Song count per artist analysis
- Artists with extensive catalogs (5+ songs)
- Top performing artists identification

### 💿 Album Analytics
- Most frequent albums in playlists
- Songs per album distribution
- Album popularity metrics
- Complete album-artist-song relationships

### 📊 Sample Query Results
- **Top 10 Most Popular Songs** with artist information
- **Longest Songs** with complete metadata
- **Average Song Duration** across different artists
- **Songs Added in Last 30 Days** for trend analysis
